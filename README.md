# MovieLens
## Overview
This repository contains algorithms for predicting user-movie ratings from the MovieLens dataset.  Namely, the algorithms we investigate the application of here are:
* **Singular Value Thresholding (SVT)**
* **Collaborative Filtering** (Cosine Similarity distance)
* **Feedforward Neural Network**

## Usage
Code for each of these algorithms can be found in `prediction_algorithms.ipynb`.
